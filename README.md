# HeritagePark
Heritage Park was developed by my team (comprising of 2 members) in the NHACK 2016 Hackathon hosted by IIT Hyderabad at Collab house, Hyderabad. We won the first prize in AR/VR category. We developed a 'Virtual Reality Endangered Species Park' to teach students from primary schools why certain animals are becoming endangered and what we can do to keep them safe.The objective of the immersive environment was to harness the power of virtual reality to inspire in its users a sense of admiration for the endangered animals and the need to conserve and protect them.  Technology used: Unity 3D.

heritagepark.unitypackage is the unitypackage for the entire project done for the Hackathon.
